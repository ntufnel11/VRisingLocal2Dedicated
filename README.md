# VRisingLocal2Dedicated
Mindgames Server Conversion Script

### WARNING

This will create a new dedicated save profile called Mindgames. Do not use if you currently have a game in the dedicated server with this name

### Using This Script
This script will take inputs for the local save directory and the dedicated server root folder in order to migrate a local V Rising game to a dedicated server. The script will then create a startup script preconfigured for this game. 

Extract the zip file to any directory and run the script. 

When prompted, input your local save directory (E.G. C:\Users\Dan\AppData\LocalLow\Stunlock Studios\VRising\Saves\v1\Game1 ).

Input your V Rising dedicated server directory (e.g. D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\VRisingDedicatedServer )

Confirm with Y when prompted and then use Start_Mindgames_Server.bat to start the server
